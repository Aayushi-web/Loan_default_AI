# 💸 Loan Payback Probability Prediction

### 🎯 Project Goal
Predict the **probability that a borrower will pay back their loan** using Machine Learning and visualize the process with a **Streamlit dashboard**.

---

## 🧠 Overview

This is an **end-to-end data science project** built with Python.  
It demonstrates:
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Model training with **LightGBM**  
- Model evaluation using various metrics  
- Deployment as an **interactive Streamlit app**

The goal is to help financial institutions predict borrower repayment probabilities efficiently.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Training Data:** `train.csv`  
- **Testing Data:** `test.csv`  

Each dataset includes borrower information such as:
- Applicant income  
- Loan amount  
- Employment type  
- Credit score  
- Debt-to-income ratio  
- Other loan-related features  

The model outputs a **probability between 0 and 1**, where higher values indicate a higher likelihood of repayment.
